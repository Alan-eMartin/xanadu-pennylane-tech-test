# Xanadu & Pennylane Tech Challenge

### Description:

We’re building a new app, and we need you to develop the navbar feature! Create a simple
React app using the framework of your choice (Vite, Create React App, Gatsby, Next.js, etc).
The app doesn’t need any content other than the navigation, but the page should be long
enough to scroll. You can add some lorem ipsum text as a placeholder. Only one page is
necessary, the navigation links don’t need to go anywhere.

As long as the below requirements are met, the design is up to you! Your design skills are not
being evaluated.

Once completed, please send us a link to the GitHub repository for the project, along with a live
link. You can deploy the project wherever you like: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, AWS, etc.

### Acceptance Criteria:

-   [ ] The navbar is built with React (bonus points for using TypeScript as well)
-   [ ] We use Tailwind CSS to style our projects, but you can use whichever styling system
        you like.
-   [ ] The navbar includes a logo/image of your choosing.
-   [ ] The navbar includes 4 text links:
    -   [ ] Products
    -   [ ] About
    -   [ ] Blog
    -   [ ] Press
-   [ ] The navbar includes 3 social links. These should be icons only (Font Awesome,
        Boxicons, etc).
    -   [ ] GitHub
    -   [ ] LinkedIn
    -   [ ] Twitter
-   [ ] The navbar should be responsive, usable on screens as small as 320px wide.
-   [ ] The navbar should be displayed at the top of the page, with no space between the
        navbar and the top or sides of the screen.
-   [ ] When scrolling down on the page, the navbar should be hidden above the fold. When
        scrolling up, the navbar should slide down and be sticky at the top of the screen.
